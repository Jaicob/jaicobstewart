							<h2>About</h2>
							<h3>"All we have to decide, is what to do with the time that is given to us"<br>
								-Gandalf, J.R.R Tolkien </h3>
							<p> As of this year I am 20 years old and currently attending the University of Georgia. I have interests in a wide array of things and often find my self exploring an assortment of hobbies such as computers, 
								biking, cars, cooking, or anything else that may spark my interests. Music is essential to my day to day life and I appreciate all forms of it. I am constantly trying to improve myself 
								through books, experiences and the influences of friends and family. I welcome change and crave adventure, but I also love to create and see others be able to make use of the work i've done.</p>

							<h2>Computer Science</h2>
							<h3>Thanks for making your way to my site, have a look around and feel free to contact me if you have any questions. </h3>
							<p> With my father and grandfather both being computer science guys, computers have been integral to my upbringing, but they weren't ever anything I thought much of nor expected to ever pursue as a career up 
								until two years ago when I started attending the University of Georgia. That first year I took a class that gave me my first exposure to programming and computer science, and ultimately lead me to deciding to study computer science
								 Looking back now I am still very happy with what I am doing and am finally getting to a point where I can start applying what i've been learning, which is exciting.   </p>

							<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
							<h3> "Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known"
								-Carl Sagan</h3>
							<p> Most recently I have been devloping an interest in mobile development and hope to go more in depth in this feild in the future. The number of mobile devices will only continue to increase and the the development 
								of mobile applications will need to continue to evolve to improve the overall experience for mobile users and I hope to make contributions in that regard. However, there is still much more out there for me to discover
								and I am open to exploring other areas more in depth as well.</p>
