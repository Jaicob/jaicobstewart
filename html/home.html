						<h2>Welcome</h2>
						<h3>Thanks for making your way to my site, have a look around and feel free to contact me if you have any questions. </h3>
						<p> This site is intended to be a place where I can display my projects, provide a means of contact, eventually start blogging, and hopefully help you to learn a little more about me. Apart from being 
							a personal site this is also intended to be a learning experience for myself as well. That being said it will constantly be being improved upon and updated. </p>
